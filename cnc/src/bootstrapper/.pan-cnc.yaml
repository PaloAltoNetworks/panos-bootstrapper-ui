        In order for a newly bootstrapped PAN-OS device to be managed by a Panorama server, a 'vm-auth-key' must
        first be generated on the Panorama server. This screen will use the provided authentication information to
        instruct the server to create this vm-auth-key, which will then be included in the bootstrap archive.
